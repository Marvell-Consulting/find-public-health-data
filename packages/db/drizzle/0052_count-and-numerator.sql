-- A value calculated from a numerator and a denominator had its numerator stored as the count, so
-- the figure moves to numerator for those value types: crude rate, directly standardised rate,
-- indirectly standardised proportion and ratio, proportion and ratio. Any other value type keeps
-- its count. The value type is the one of the version the observation's batch was uploaded to.
-- A survey indicator whose count is an estimated number of people rather than its numerator, such
-- as smoking prevalence from the Annual Population Survey (92443), keeps its count too.
-- Rebuilding the secondary indexes after the rewrite is quicker than updating them row by row.
