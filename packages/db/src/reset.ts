 * Return the database to the state of a freshly created one, so `db migrate` rebuilds it
 * from empty. Recreating the public schema wholesale beats dropping objects one kind at a
 * time: there is no catalog sweep to keep in step with whatever object kinds migrations
 * create next. What `CREATE SCHEMA` cannot restore is put back explicitly — a new
 * database owns public through pg_database_owner and grants USAGE to PUBLIC. The
 * extensions go with the schema; the first migration reinstalls them. Roles are never
 * touched — `db bootstrap` owns those. Callers own the safety decision, via
 * assertResetAllowed.
