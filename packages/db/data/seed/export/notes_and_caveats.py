"""The service's notes and caveats answers for Fingertips' three prose fields.

Fingertips holds disclosure control, caveats and notes as prose alone, where the service
asks whether each applies and keeps the prose as the detail of a yes. Prose that says no
more than "none" or "not applicable" in one of the forms in VOCABULARY becomes that answer
and is dropped; any other prose is kept as the detail of a yes. Blank prose leaves the
question unanswered, since Fingertips recorded no answer, and rounding, which Fingertips
has no field for, stays unanswered too.
