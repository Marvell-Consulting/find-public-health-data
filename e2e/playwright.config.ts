// End-to-end tests. Specs drive the running apps over HTTP against the base URLs below —
// they never import app code, and nothing here starts the stack: locally that is `pnpm dev`
// (or any dev:mixed split) in another terminal, in CI the compose containers.
//
// Specs run in parallel workers against one shared seeded database, which makes one rule
// load-bearing: a spec never mutates data another spec reads. A test of a write flow creates
// its own rows and asserts on those; a flow that genuinely cannot own its data gets a serial
// project then, not speculatively now.
